# IoT-conference-badge - Firmware
Firmware that needs to be written on the badge including helper script like bulk flashing and QR code generator from serial numbers that get written out during bulk flashing.

## Seting up dev environment
This is W.I.P. and I'm trying out to use VisualStudio code for this and adding a Makefile at some point.
Please see https://github.com/rac2030/IoT-conference-badge/wiki/Firmware-developement-environment-setup for details.
