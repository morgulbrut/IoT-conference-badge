$CMP JUMPER-SMT_2_NC
D Normally closed trace jumper This jumper has a trace between two pads so it's normally closed (NC). Use a razor knife to open the connection. For best results follow the IPC guidelines for cutting traces: <ul><li>Cutout at least 0.063 mm (0.005 in).</li><li>Remove all loose material to clean up the cut area.</li><li>Seal the cut with an approved epoxy.</li></ul>Reapply solder to reclose the connection.
